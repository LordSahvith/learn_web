          <p>(v.o) Thank you for using. (Marty gets up. Behind him, a Japanese man appears on the screen. It's Marty's boss, Iko Fujitsu - aka the Jitz.) McFly! (Jennifer jumps at this. Marty turns around to see his boss.) Oh! Fujitsu-san! Konnichi wa!Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. (He runs inside his house and shuts the door behind him.) (to himself) Science Fiction Theater. (George's Room - Night) (Marty arrives in his radiation suit and helmet. He places headphones on George's head as he sleeps, and then pops a Van Halen tape into the walkman and presses play. George wakes up with a jerk, holding his head.)Doc, what if we don't succeed? We must succeed! (Hill Valley – 1955) (The DeLorean arrives just outside of where they are beginning to build Lyon Estates. Doc and Marty get out of the car.) Ah, this is heavy Doc. I mean it's like I was just here yesterday.Help me move Jennifer over here! (Marty and Doc lift Jennifer out of the DeLorean.) So what's the deal? Grab her feet. (Marty does, and they put Jennifer down by the discarded laser discs.)</p>
